* STOW: Simplified Dotfile Management

STOW (Store in Warehouse) is a command-line utility that uses symlinks to manage configuration files. This tool is particularly useful for maintaining dotfiles in a central directory, keeping your home directory clean, and allowing easy version control and deployment across different systems.

** Key Features
- *Symlink Management*: Creates symbolic links, avoiding duplication.
- *Easy Deployment*: Simplifies deploying configurations across multiple systems.
- *Version Control Friendly*: Works seamlessly with Git and other VCS tools.
- *Modularity*: Allows managing different sets of configurations as separate packages.

** Installation
To install STOW, use the following command:

- On Debian-based systems:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sudo apt-get install stow
  #+END_SRC

- On macOS using Homebrew:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  brew install stow
  #+END_SRC

** Usage
1. **Organize Your Dotfiles**:
   - Create a central directory for your dotfiles, e.g., `~/dotfiles`.
   - Inside this directory, create subdirectories for each configuration set (e.g., `~/dotfiles/zsh`).

2. **Deploy Configurations**:
   Navigate to your dotfiles directory and use STOW to deploy configurations:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   cd ~/dotfiles
   stow zsh
   stow vim
   #+END_SRC

   This will create symlinks in your home directory pointing to the files in `~/dotfiles/zsh` and `~/dotfiles/vim`.

3. **Remove Symlinks**:
   To remove symlinks, use the `-D` option:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   stow -D zsh
   #+END_SRC

** Example
If you have a `.zshrc` file in `~/dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc`, after running `stow zsh`, a symlink from `~/.zshrc` to `~/dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc` will be created.

** Conclusion
STOW simplifies the management of dotfiles by keeping your configurations centralized, clean, and version-controlled, making it an essential tool for any developer's toolkit.
